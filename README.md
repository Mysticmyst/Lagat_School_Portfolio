# HCI School-Portfolio
This repository is for the final project of team member(Reynette Lagat) of TEAM SL in the course subject of HCI. Along with the team's logo, a Coursera certificate, and a user manual, it includes the necessary files required for the project. The User Manual showcases a user-friendly video of the project prototype flow that demonstrates the team's learnings from the HCI concepts and offers comprehensive instructions for everything you need to know about their project.

# Team Logo 
The official logo design made for the TEAM SL was focused on the starting initial of both memebers' surnames which were S and L, accompanied with simply adding the word "team" to describe unity, team spirit and teamwork within the group. The colors and font style focus on something leaned towards futuristic; something simple yet striking.
